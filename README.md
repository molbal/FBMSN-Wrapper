# Messenger.com Electron wrapper

I made this wrapper, because I like 'proper client applications' and Facebook messenger lacks one. I figured messenger.com is as close as it can get to one so why not wrap it in Electron to make it feel like a desktop application.

### Why don't you use the one available in Windows Store?
I tried it, but I had some concerns.

- It was slow as heck
- There is no option to turn it off. It always shows that you are online and always receives notifications even if you close it. No option in the tray either to shut it down

### So what are you trying to achieve here?
I haven't worked with Node JS or Electron yet, so this is a very easy starting project.

### Other
I used an Electron Boilerplate from here: https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate
